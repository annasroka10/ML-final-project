What is the dataset about?

The dataset contains information about people and their medical expenses (insurance charges). It has factors like:

Age (how old the person is)
Sex (gender)
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Children (how many children they have)
Smoker (whether they smoke or not)
Region (where they live)
Charges (the medical cost or insurance charge)
This data is used to predict how much a new person might pay for medical insurance based on their details.

Problem Statement:

What factors impact medical expenses the most?

We want to know which factors, like age or smoking, have the biggest effect on medical costs.

How accurate can we predict medical expenses?

We will build a machine learning model to predict how much someone will pay based on their data (age, smoking, etc.) and see how accurate the predictions are.
